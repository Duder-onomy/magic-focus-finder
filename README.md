# Magic Focus Finder

Intended to help keyboard navigation through html nodes.

This is heavily influenced by (and sort of a rip off of) this repo: [jquery.keyJumper](https://github.com/mbitto/jquery.keyJumper)
The diff will be

1. no jquery
2. using mutation observers to know when new focusable elements are added / removed from the DOM.
3. full custom event support so that it will work with custom elements and dom binding libraries seemless.
3. customizable key mapping so that I can use it with TV remote controls.
4. wrap in integration tests
5. semvar and bower
6. amd compliant
7. full wiki and examples page

Rawk.
